# Pythton_Chess
A normal game of chess built using python and pygame. I made this for the final project in my Engr 102 class at Texas A&amp;M in my first semester of my Freshman year.
The game works for 1 or 2 players. 


BUGS/OTHER THINGS TO FIX:
  AI - the AI for the computer when doing 1-player is not really AI. It is just checking for a random valid move and is doing it
  
  Bishops - The Bishops, and by extension the Queens when moving diagnol, do not always work
